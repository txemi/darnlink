## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-11

First public release.

### Added
- **Repair**: fix robust Markdown links whose target moved or was renamed, matched by the target's
  `uuid` (exact match — no heuristics, no network).
- **Robustify**: upgrade a plain relative link to a robust one — anchor it to the target's `uuid`
  (added to the target's frontmatter if missing) via an inline `<!-- uuid: … -->` comment.
- **Conflict detection**: when a link's path still resolves but its anchored `uuid` points elsewhere,
  report a conflict instead of silently rewriting the path.
- CLI: dry-run by default; `--write` to apply; `--robustify`, `--create-frontmatter`,
  `--exclude`, `--ignore-block`, `--no-create-frontmatter-for`, `--json`.
- Cross-platform I/O: preserves original line endings (CRLF/LF); reads UTF-8 with BOM.
- Ships a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook (`darnlink`, `darnlink-repair`).
- Format specification: [FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md).
